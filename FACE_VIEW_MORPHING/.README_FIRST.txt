This is the guide to use the defined functions.

> Find the three .m file 

1) Face_Detection_through_Morphing ----Does view morphing and detects eyes and mouth 
					in the morphed image. (multiple figures appear, dont worry)

2)FaceMorphing---face morphing is for video output of pose variation.


3)stillimage_morphing ---still image is for the still image output, also eye and mouth 
			 detection in the morpher image


> in the .m files u can change the image which will be subjected to morphing

 >> Based on the requierement select the images
    >>> example UP1 and DOWN1 FOR vertical pose variation
    >>> t1 and t2 for horizontal pose variation

 >> Run the code 
 >> wait for a while  (3sec)
    ..........................


    >>> Observe the output video or the still image.

>The results will also get stored in the host file
